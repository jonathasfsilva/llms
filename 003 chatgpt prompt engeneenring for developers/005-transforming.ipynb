Yes, adults also like pandas too.  She takes it everywhere with her, and it's super soft and cute.  One of the ears is a bit lower than the other, and I don't think that was designed to be asymmetrical. It's a bit small for what I paid for it though. I think there might be other options that are bigger for the same price.  It arrived a day earlier than expected, so I got to play with it myself before I gave it to my daughter."

The plush is incredibly soft and cute, my daughter carries it everywhere. However, I did notice that one ear is slightly lower than the other, which seems unintentional. Despite this, I found the size to be a bit smaller than expected given the price. I believe there are larger options available for the same cost. On a positive note, the delivery was prompt, arriving a day earlier than anticipated, allowing me to enjoy playing with it before gifting it to my daughter."
